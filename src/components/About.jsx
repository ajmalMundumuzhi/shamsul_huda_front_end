                Shamsul Huda is founded upon the educational philosophy of Islam which in turn is inspired by the principles of hierarchy and unity of knowledge in its intents, contents, and methods. Therefore, our philosophy is based on recognizing the Almighty Allah as the fountain-source of all knowledge as well as acknowledging Him as the ultimate end of every human endeavor; and believing that His guidance (Hidaya) is an absolute essentiality for human development. Hence, we stand with a clear-cut philosophy that the knowledge should be acquired, internalized, and propagated (Ta'lim, Tarbiyah, Dawah) for the sake of the Almighty Allah and for the benefit of the self and people.
